# AI Webhook Router 

A scalable microservices-based platform to **ingest, classify, process, and deliver webhooks** from external services like Stripe, GitHub, Zapier, etc.  
The system ensures reliable processing with retries, logging, monitoring, and secure API key authentication.

---

## 📌 Features
- **Webhook Ingestion** → Accepts incoming webhooks with headers & payloads.
- **AI-based Classification** → Categorizes events (e.g., billing, code, alerts).
- **Retry Queue** → Failed deliveries are retried with exponential backoff.
- **Processing Service** → Extracts structured results from raw payloads.
- **Delivery Service** → Sends processed results to configured destinations.
- **Auth Service** → API key-based authentication & permissions.
- **Analytics** → Logs, dashboards, and insights for webhook traffic.
- **Scalable** → Built with microservices + message queues + PostgreSQL.

## 🗄️ Database Schema (Key Tables)

- **users** → Manages platform users.  
- **api_keys** → API key storage (hashed).  
- **ingestion.logs** → Stores raw incoming webhooks.  
- **processed_results** → Stores AI-processed data.  
- **delivery_logs** → Tracks delivery attempts.  
- **retry_queue** → Handles retries for failed deliveries.

## ⚡ Setup & Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/webhook-platform.git
cd webhook-platform
````

### 2️⃣ Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file at the project root and configure:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/webhooks

# Auth
JWT_SECRET=supersecret

# Other configs
PORT=4000
```

### 3️⃣ Start Services with Docker

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start:

* PostgreSQL
* All microservices (ingestion, router, processing, delivery, auth, analytics)

### 4️⃣ Run Database Migrations

```bash
npm run migrate   # or use your migration tool (e.g., Knex/Prisma/TypeORM)
```

### 5️⃣ Test API Gateway

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/webhooks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: <your_api_key>" \
  -d '{"event": "payment.succeeded", "amount": 100}'
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Logs

* Logs stored in `ingestion.logs` & `delivery_logs`.
* Retry logic managed via `retry_queue`.
* Analytics service aggregates events for dashboards.

---

## 🚀 Roadmap

* [ ] Add Kafka/Redis Streams for async processing
* [ ] Add Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring
* [ ] Expose GraphQL API for analytics
* [ ] Add support for rate-limiting per API key
